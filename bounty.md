# Best Developer Tooling or Education

Create tooling or education that makes building on 0G easier: SDKs, templates, CLIs, debugging tools, dashboards, tutorials, or interactive learning. Must be reusable, well-documented, and immediately helpful to other devs.

🥇 Number of Projects Awarded

🏆 Winner Breakdown
1st Place: $2,500
2nd Place: $1,500

If there are not two top projects, we might only give out prizing to a single winner, or we may adjust prize amounts. If no project is good enough to win, we'll explain why.

📝 Requirements
Deliver either:
Tooling (code) or
Education (content + runnable examples).
Must be open source with clear setup steps.
Must include at least one working example demonstrating use.
Should reduce a real friction point (setup, deployment, debugging, learning).
✅ What does a successful project look like?
Positive ideas:

One-command starter (scaffold + deploy + verify).
Educational resources: Starter courses, and guided development tools.
Indexing/observability: dashboards for txns, storage objects, compute jobs.
Example project: "0G Quickstart Kit".

CLI: create-0g-app
Generates a template dApp (contract + frontend + storage/compute integration)
Includes local dev scripts, testnet deploy, and a demo UI
README with copy-paste steps and troubleshooting
🎨 UI/UX Design Requirements
CLI or browser based UIs are acceptable.
